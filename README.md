### What I learned

I have gained valuable experience in honing my skills with React, as well as improving my proficiency in TypeScript and the logical required for the project. Working with React has allowed me to deepen my understanding of its powerful components and the efficient management of state and props. Additionally, integrating TypeScript into the development process has enhanced my ability to write cleaner, more robust code while catching potential errors early on. The project's complexity and logic challenges have provided me with opportunities to think critically and problem-solve effectively, ultimately expanding my overall skill set in front-end development.
